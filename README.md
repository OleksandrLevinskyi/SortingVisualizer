# Sorting Visualizer
It is an interactive application built for visualizing sorting algorithms to understand your understanding of them. There are implemented 7 algorithms: Heap, Quick, Merge, Radix, Intertion, Selection, and Bubble sorts.

# Video Demo

After launching algorithm, you will see its description at the bottom of the page with:
* Time/Space Complexities
* Number of comparisons
* Number of Array Manipulations (number of swaps/value changes)
